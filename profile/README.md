# About MioHosting
MioHosting is an organization that develops panels and tools for management of personal Minecraft servers.

⚠️**MioHosting itself is NOT a server host and will not host your server for you.
We also do not make panels for server hosting services and we ask that our panels are not used for this either, we do not support functionality or stability for large amounts of servers.**

What our panels should provide:
- Quick and easy setup for servers
  - Easy selection of softwares/versions
  - Simple plugin/mods uploading or deleting
  - Easy and understandable configuration of plugins
- Easy management of servers
  - Manage everything at the click of a few buttons
  - Easily read logs using the [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs) service by Aternos
  - Easily access and configure your Minecraft worlds, including uploading, regenerating...
  - Easily manage players on your server
- Clean and clear design

## MioPanel - our first panel is still in development. Please be patient.
MioHosting only has one developer, and development may take a while.

If you are looking for Minecraft server hosts, we have some recommendations:
- [Aternos](https://aternos.org): Minecraft servers. Free. Forever.
- [exaroton](https://exaroton.com): A usage based paid host, made by Aternos GmbH.
